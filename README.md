# Unveiling Emotions

‘Unveiling Emotions’ is a series of artworks whose meaning is hidden and can only be proven through cryptography.

Exploring abstraction and cryptography as distinct sources of artistic expression that go beyond the visual realm.

Zero-Knowledge Proofs, used as an integral part of the artworks, enable us to prove information without revealing it - keeping the artist’s intent (meaning/emotion) behind each piece a secret. While its visual manifestation is unveiled and exhibited.

Inviting the viewers to decipher which emotion was creatively expressed through these creations.

Leading the audience from the seen to the unseen. By shifting awareness on your ‘inner world’ and feeling what emotions these artworks manifest/provoke in yourself. Viewers will be able to submit their emotions.

The paradox of trying to find the verifiable truth, when the truth in art is subjective.
